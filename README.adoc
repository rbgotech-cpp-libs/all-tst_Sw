=== Description

This repository represents a library that is all about time and timing, for 32 and 64 bit systems. Note the call deps above; if a system lacks one of those, this lib is probably not usable.

2+^m|`#Sleep#` functions +

|void slp_ns_f64(Tf64 s)
|Nano precision sleep function taking double precision float input.

|void slp_ns_u32(Tu32 s, Tu32 ns);
|Sleep function taking two 32 bits inputs; one for whole seconds, one for nano sub division of a second: 0...999,999,999.

|void slp_us_f32(Tf32 s);
|Micro precision sleep function expressed in single precision float input.


2+^m|`#Time Stamp Counter#` functions +

|Tu64 tsc_ns_u64();
|Timestamp counter returning nanoseconds since unix epoch.

|Tf64 tsc_ns_f64(Tu64 *cnv=0);
|Same as previous but in double precision float format, having the nano seconds after the floating point.

|Tu32 tsc_ns_u32();
|Returns nanoseconds in 32 bits unsigned format, which means that overflow occurs every 4.29 seconds. This can be used for seeding a random number generator.

|Tu32 tsc_us_u32();
|Returns microseconds in 32 bits unsigned format, which means that overflow occurs every 4294.9 seconds or roughly 1:10h.

|Tf32 tsc_us_f32(Tu32 *cnv=0);
|Same as previous, but in floating point format, having the microseconds after the floating point.


2+^m|`#class Sw(64\|32)#`
2+d|
A simple stopwatch class, to measure time intervals. +
The 64 bit version has nano and the 32 bit version has micro precision. +
The 64 bit uses tsc_us_u64() and the 32 bits uses tsc_us_u32() functions at the core. These are unsigned and will have correct outcome also when calculating difference separated by overflow. +
Read the comments on tsc_us_u32(); take note about the limited time span it addresses.

|void start();
|Snapshot and records current timestamp.

|Tf(64\|32) stop();
|Return snapshot current timestamp minus the one recorded at start();
which is the time interval elapsed since calling start();

|void stopb(char* buf, const char *pfx="", const char *sfx="");
|Same as stop(), but create a string inside buf, having float format %.6f or %.9f, preceded by pfx and followed by sfx.

|void stopp(const char *pfx="", const char *sfx="");
|Same as stopb(), but printf it immediately.
